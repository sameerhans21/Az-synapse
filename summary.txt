Azure Synapse Analytics Data Pipeline
Technologies: Azure Synapse Analytics, PySpark, SQL, Data Lake, Delta Lake

  Developed and deployed a data pipeline in Azure Synapse Analytics for data ingestion, transformation, and storage.
  Queried data from an Azure Data Lake using serverless SQL pools and created external tables with CETAS for efficient querying.
  Used Apache Spark pools to analyze and visualize large datasets stored in the data lake.
  Implemented Delta Lake tables for ACID-compliant data processing and optimized storage.
  Designed and managed ETL workflows using Azure Synapse Pipelines, automating data movement and transformations.
  Ensured optimized performance using massively parallel processing (MPP) in Synapse's dedicated SQL pools.


Network Monitoring and Analytics with FlexRIC & Azure Synapse
Technologies: FlexRIC (Near-RT RIC), xApp, Azure Blob Storage, Azure Synapse Analytics, JSON, PySpark

  Deployed FlexRIC in simulation mode with a gNB agent (emu_agent_gnb), Near-RT RIC, and an xApp to monitor network performance.
  Captured and processed real-time network monitoring logs from the xApp, converting them into structured JSON files.
  Automated the ingestion of monitoring data into Azure Blob Storage for centralized storage and further processing.
  Integrated Azure Synapse Analytics to analyze and visualize network insights using PySpark and SQL queries.
  Developed a cloud-based data pipeline for efficient monitoring, storage, and analysis of RAN performance metrics.
