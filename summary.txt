Azure Synapse Analytics Data Pipeline
Technologies: Azure Synapse Analytics, PySpark, SQL, Data Lake, Delta Lake

  Developed and deployed a data pipeline in Azure Synapse Analytics for data ingestion, transformation, and storage.
  Queried data from an Azure Data Lake using serverless SQL pools and created external tables with CETAS for efficient querying.
  Used Apache Spark pools to analyze and visualize large datasets stored in the data lake.
  Implemented Delta Lake tables for ACID-compliant data processing and optimized storage.
  Designed and managed ETL workflows using Azure Synapse Pipelines, automating data movement and transformations.
  Ensured optimized performance using massively parallel processing (MPP) in Synapse's dedicated SQL pools.


Network Monitoring and Analytics with FlexRIC & Azure Synapse
Technologies: FlexRIC (Near-RT RIC), xApp, Azure Blob Storage, Azure Synapse Analytics, JSON, PySpark

  Deployed FlexRIC in simulation mode with a gNB agent (emu_agent_gnb), Near-RT RIC, and an xApp to monitor network performance.
  Captured and processed real-time network monitoring logs from the xApp, converting them into structured JSON files.
  Automated the ingestion of monitoring data into Azure Blob Storage for centralized storage and further processing.
  Integrated Azure Synapse Analytics to analyze and visualize network insights using PySpark and SQL queries.
  Developed a cloud-based data pipeline for efficient monitoring, storage, and analysis of RAN performance metrics.

1. Modify xApp to Stream Logs Directly â€“ AZURE EVENT HUB

2. Set Up Azure Event Hub for Real-Time Data Ingestion
Azure Event Hub will act as a real-time buffer for incoming xApp logs.

3. Process Data in Real-Time Using Azure Stream Analytics
Create an Azure Stream Analytics Job.
Input: Select Azure Event Hub as the source.
Output: Send processed data to Blob Storage.
Query: Use SQL queries to filter and transform and analyse data.

4. Visualize Data in Real-Time in Azure Synapse
Use Power BI to create real-time visualizations.
Query the Synapse table in real-time to track network performance.
